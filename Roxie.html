  <p>Once it said in the paper:<br>
  'gangland's Al Capelli seen at Chez Vito with cute blonde chorine'<br>
  That was me.<br>
  I clipped it and I saved it.<br>
  why'know, all my life i wanted to was have my own act<br>
  But no. No, no, no<br>
  Always no<br>
  One big world full of 'no'<br>
  Then? Amos came along<br>
  Safe, sweet Amos<br>
  Who never says 'no'<br>
  Lookit.<br>
  I've never done this before<br>
  But this is such a special night<br>
  And you are such a great audience!<br>
  And..And i just.. really feel like i can talk to you, why'know?<br>
  So, Forget what you've read in the papers!<br>
  And forget what you've heard on the radio!<br>
  because, because... I'm gonna tell you the truth<br>
  -not that the truth really matters-<br>
  But, I'm gonna tell ya anyways..<br>
  In the bed department?<br>
  Amos was... ZERO<br>
  i mean, when he made love to me, it was, like, he was fixing a carbouretter or sommink<br>
  'i love ya honey, i love ya'<br>
  Anywaays... I started fooling around<br>
  Then i started screwing around<br>
  -which is fooling around without dinner-<br>
  Then, I met Fred Casely<br>
  Wo said he could get me into Vaudeville<br>
  but, That didn't really work out as i planned<br>
  and I guess it didn't work out too great for fred either<br>
  So, I gave up on the Vaudeville idea<br>
  Because you figure after all those years<br>
  Opportunity's just passed you by</p>
  <p>But it ain't<br>
  Oh, no, no, no, no<br>
  But it ain't</p>
  <p>And now?<br>
  well, if this Flynn guy gets me off<br>
  With all this publicity<br>
  I'm in a whole word of<br>
  YES!</p>
  <p>The name on everybody's lips<br>
  Is gonna be Roxie<br>
  The lady raking in the chips<br>
  Is gonna be Roxie</p>
  <p>I'm gonna be a celebrity<br>
  That means<br>
  Somebody everyone knows<br>
  They('re) gonna recognize my eyes<br>
  My hair my teeth my boobs my nose</p>
  <p>From just some dumb mechanics wife<br>
  I'm gonna be Roxie<br>
  Who says that murder's not an art?</p>
  <p>And who in case she doesn't hang<br>
  Can say she started with a bang?<br>
  Roxie Hart!</p>
  <p>Boys...<br>
  They're gonna wait outside in line<br>
  To get to see</p>
  <p>Roxie<br>
  Think of those autographs<br>
  I'll sign,<br>
  'Good luck to ya, '</p>
  <p>Roxie!</p>
  <p>And I'll appear<br>
  In a lavalier that goes<br>
  All the way down to my waist</p>
  <p>Here a ring,<br>
  There a ring,<br>
  Everywhere a-ring-a-ling</p>
  <p>But always in the best of taste!</p>
  <p>Mmmm, I'm a star!<br>
  And the audience loves me!<br>
  And I love them<br>
  And they love me for loving them<br>
  And I love them for loving me<br>
  And we love each other<br>
  And that's because none of us<br>
  Got enough love in our childhoods<br>
  And that's showbiz<br>
  Kid</p>
  <p>She's given up her hum drum life</p>
  <p>I'm gonna be sing it</p>
  <p>Roxie<br>
  She made a scandal and a start</p>
